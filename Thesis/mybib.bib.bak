Its development was considered to be an important step in reducing the fragmentation that was witnessed between the existing process modeling tools and notations. Since then BPMN has been evaluated in different ways by the academic community and has become widely supported and used by industry. After completing the first major revisions of BPMN, the Object Management Group (OMG) released BPMN 2.0 in 2011. This chapter gives an overview of BPMN 2.0 and summarizes some of the evaluations of BPMN used for analysis and design of business processes and presents these together with reported experiences as well as some examples of proposed extensions and future expectations based on these. We will based on this also present some implications for practitioners.},

While most of the current work on IoT integration focuses on areas of the actual technical implementation, little attention has been given to the integration of the IoT paradigm and its devices coming with native software components as resources in business processes of traditional enterprise resource planning systems. In this paper, we identify and integrate IoT resources as a novel automatic resource type on the business process layer beyond the classical human resource task-centric view of the business process model in order to face expanding resource planning challenges of future enterprise environments.},

In this chapter, we analyse existing proposals for resource modelling, focusing on solutions for both resource representation and application representation. Proposals for resource representation can be grouped into three main categories: attribute-basedAttribute-based        , semantic-basedSemantic-based         and virtualization-basedVirtualization-based        . After presenting some examples for each category, we briefly discuss them under three aspects: the degrees of abstraction, granularity and formalism with which the elements are represented in the models. It is important to mention that, although several works implicitly assume some type of representation for the system resources and also for the application, in our discussion we included only the proposals that explicitly define their models, with sufficient details to shed light in the relevant aspects of such models.},

  abstract  = {The emerging Internet of Things provides a networked infrastructure that enables incremental business transformation as well as radical business changes. So far, the full potential of possible business opportunities has not been leveraged. Within this chapter we propose the concept of business models and business model innovation as a means to align ``technological development and economic value creation'' (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002) in the Internet of Things. A central point of this paper is the value and revenue creation in the Internet of Things. We consider information to be the main source for value proposition. To investigate resulting impacts, we draw on the ``laws of information'' proposed by Moore and Walsh (2002) and deduct specifics for the Internet of Things. Building on this, we describe four exemplary business model scenarios. These are visualised using the business model framework by Osterwalder and Pigneur (2009). This framework, the fundamental rules of value creation through information in the Internet of Things and the provided examples may serve as a tool-set for practitioners to analyse and change their business models when implementing the Internet of Things.},
